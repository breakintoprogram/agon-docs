In the [Agon Projects Git](https://github.com/breakintoprogram/agon-projects), there are a handful of useful templates and projects.

# The Templates

There are three template projects that can be used as a basis for your projects:

- A 16-bit mode Hello World app in assembler that demonstrates calling the MOS from a 64K segment in Z80 mode
- A 24-bit mode Hello World app in assembler
- A 24-bit mode Hello World app in C

All three apps act as MOS extensions; the resultant binary can be copied into the `mos` folder on the SD card, can be executed as a star command, and will display any passed parameters.

# The Applications

- A memory dump application written as a 16-bit mode assembly language app.
- An eZ80 disassembler written as a C application.

Both can be run as star commands from MOS.

# What is the VPD

The VDP is the Agon's Visual Display Processor. It is responsible for:

* Video output via the VGA connector
* Audio output via the built-in buzzer and audio jack
* Keyboard input via the PS/2 connector

It runs on the ESP32 co-processor and uses the FabGL library to support those functions.

At a higher level, its input is a byte stream from the eZ80F92 main CPU over an internal high-speed UART connection @ 1,152,000 baud (384,000 baud for versions of MOS/VPD prior to 1.03). This stream contains a mixture of text and control characters. These control characters are mapped to the BBC BASIC VDU control characters, a choice made as BBC BASIC for Agon is the pre-installed programming language of Agon.

The ESP32 also outputs data back to the eZ80F92, for example keyboard data and screen information via a custom serial protocol.

## Executing a VDU sequence

### From BBC BASIC

The VDU command interprets each of the integer values following the keyword as an ASCII value. Values between 0 and 255 are accepted, and are separated by commas. If the value is immediately followed by a semicolon `;` then the value is a little-endian word from 0 to 65535.

Example:

`VDU 25, 0, 640; 512;`: Plot a dot in the center of the screen

### From MOS (Version 1.03 or greater)

The VDU command accepts values between 0 and 255 and are separated by spaces.

Example:

`VDU 17 15`: Set the text foreground colour to 15

## VDU Character Sequences

The VDU command is a work-in-progress with a handful of mappings implemented.

- `VDU 8`: Cursor left
- `VDU 9`: Cursor right
- `VDU 10`: Cursor down
- `VDU 11`: Cursor up
- `VDU 12`: CLS
- `VDU 13`: Carriage return
- `VDU 14`: Page mode ON (VDP 1.03 or greater)
- `VDU 15`: Page mode OFF (VDP 1.03 or greater)
- `VDU 16`: CLG
- `VDU 17 colour`: COLOUR colour
- `VDU 18, mode, colour`: GCOL mode, colour
- `VDU 19, l, p, r, g, b`: COLOUR l, p / COLOUR l, r, g, b
- `VDU 22, n`: Mode n
- `VDU 23, n`: UDG / System Commands
- `VDU 24, left; bottom; right; top;`: Set graphics viewport (VDP 1.04 or greater)
- `VDU 25, mode, x; y;`: PLOT mode, x, y
- `VDU 26`: Reset graphics and text viewports (VDP 1.04 or greater)
- `VDU 28, left, bottom, right, top`: Set text viewport (VDP 1.04 or greater)
- `VDU 29, x; y;`: Graphics origin
- `VDU 30`: Home cursor
- `VDU 31, x, y`: TAB(x, y)
- `VDU 127`: Backspace

All other characters are sent to the screen as ASCII, unaltered.

## VDU 23, 0: VPD commands

VDU 23, 0 is reserved for commands sent to the VDP

- `VDU 23, 0, &81, n`: Set the keyboard locale (0=UK, 1=US, etc) 
- `VDU 23, 0, &82`: Request text cursor position
- `VDU 23, 0, &83, x; y;`: Get ASCII code of character at character position x, y
- `VDU 23, 0, &84, x; y;`: Get colour of pixel at pixel position x, y
- `VDU 23, 0, &85, channel, command, volume, freq; duration;`: Send a command to the [VDP Enhanced Audio API](VDP-‚Äê-Enhanced-Audio-API.md)
- `VDU 23, 0, &86`: Fetch the screen dimensions 
- `VDU 23, 0, &87`: RTC control (Requires MOS 1.03 or above)
- `VDU 23, 0, &88, delay; rate; led`: Keyboard Control (Requires MOS 1.03 or above)
- `VDU 23, 0, &C0, n`: Turn logical screen scaling on and off, where 1=on and 0=off (Requires MOS 1.03 or above)
- `VDU 23, 0, &A0, bufferId, command, <args>`: Buffered command support
- `VDU 23, 0, &C0, n`: Set logical coordinate mode
- `VDU 23, 0, &C1, n`: Switch legacy modes on or off
- `VDU 23, 0, &C3`: Flip the screen buffer (double-buffered modes only)
- `VDU 23, 0, &FF`: Switch to terminal mode for CP/M (This will disable keyboard entry in BBC BASIC/MOS)

Commands between &82 and &88 will return their data back to the eZ80 via the serial protocol

NB:

- Prior to MOS 1.03 these were indexed from &00, not &80. For example, `VDU 23, 0, &02` to request the cursor position.

## RTC control

- `VDU 23, 0, 7, 0`: Read the RTC
- `VDU 23, 0, 7, 1, y, m, d, h, m, s`: Set the RTC

## VDU 23, 1: Cursor display

- `VDU 23, 1, 0`: Disable the text cursor
- `VDU 23, 1, 1`: Enable the text cursor

## VDU 23, 7: Scrolling

- `VDU 23, 7, extent, direction, speed`: Scroll the screen

## VDU 23, 16: Define Cursor Behaviour (Requires VDP 1.04 or greater)

- `VDU 23, 16, setting, mask`: Specify [cursor behaviour](#cursor-behaviour) by ANDing with mask then XORing with setting

## VDU 23, 27: Sprites and Bitmaps

VDU 23, 27 is reserved for the bitmap and sprite functionality

### Bitmaps

- `VDU 23, 27, 0, n`: Select bitmap n
- `VDU 23, 27, 1, w; h; b1, b2 ... bn`: Load colour bitmap data into current bitmap

## Serial Protocol

Data sent from the VPD to the eZ80's UART0 is sent as a packet in the following format:

- cmd: The packet command, with bit 7 set
- len: Number of data bytes
- data: The data byte(s)

Words are 16 bit, and sent in little-endian format

Packets:

- `0x00`: General Poll
- `0x01, keycode, modifiers, vkey, keydown`: Keyboard state
- `0x02, x, y`: Cursor position
- `0x03, char`: Character read from screen
- `0x04, r, g, b, index`: Pixel colour read from screen
- `0x05, channel, success`: Audio play note acknowledgement
- `0x06, width, height, cols, rows, colours`: Screen dimensions - width and height are words
- `0x07, year, month, day, dayOfYear, dayOfWeek, hour, minute, second`: RTC data
- `0x08, delay, rate, led`: Keyboard status - delay and rate are words

## Keyboard

When a key is pressed, a packet is sent with the following data:
- cmd: 0x01
- keycode: The ASCII value of the key pressed
- modifiers: A byte with the following bits set (1 = pressed):
```
0. CTRL
1. SHIFT
2. ALT LEFT
3. ALT RIGHT
4. CAPS LOCK
5. NUM LOCK
6. SCROLL LOCK
7. GUI
```
From VDP 1.03, the following key data is also returned
- vkey: The FabGL virtual keycode
- keydown: 1 if the key is down, 0 if the key is up

## Cursor Behaviour

The following bits are implemented in VDU 23, 16

- `Bit 0 = 1`: Enable scroll protection - text cursor will not scroll when it moves off the bottom/right of the viewport
- `Bit 0 = 0`: Disable scroll protection (default)
- `Bit 4 = 1`: Text cursor will wrap to top of screen when it moves off the bottom of the screen
- `Bit 4 = 0`: Text cursor will scroll when it moves off the bottom of the screen (default)
- `Bit 5 = 1`: Cursor does not move right after a character is printed
- `Bit 5 = 0`: Cursor moves right after a character is printed (default)
- `Bit 6 = 1`: Graphics cursor (VDU 5 mode) carries on off edge of graphics viewport
- `Bit 6 = 0`: Graphics cursor does an implicit cr/lf when it moves off right of graphics viewport (default)

## Screen Modes

Modes over 128 are double-buffered
